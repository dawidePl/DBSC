# Database Sketch Converter

---

## Short description

Database Sketch Converter is a program that converts a database sketch into ready SQL queries ready to paste into the console.<br /><br />
It may save time if you want to create a sketch first and not bother writing SQL or creating a table(s) in xampp or any other DB-CMS.

### Motivation

I wrote this as a school project and a thingy to save me time in school and my personal projects involving database(s). I hope it may save others time or bring them motivation for their own project.

### Future plans

I plan to change the sketch syntax completely, allow for more freedom, maybe introduce templates and some other advanced stuff. Not sure how that'll go though.
